Shadow Defend is a tower defence game where the player must attempt to defend the map from enemies using towers. As such, there are two main components of the game: slicers (the enemy), and towers.

Towers are manually purchased by the player and can be placed on a non-blocked area of the map. There are different types of towers, each with different characteristics, but the overall goal of a tower is to prevent slicers from exiting the map.

Slicers are the main antagonists of the game. They spawn at varying points during a wave. Like towers, there are different types of slicers, each with different characteristics, but the overall goal of a slicer is to reach the ‘exit’ of the map.
